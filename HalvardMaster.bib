	abstract = {Car-following and continuum theories have been shown by other investigators to describe a number of aspects of the complex phenomenon of vehicular traffic flow in both quantitative and qualitative terms. It is the purpose of this paper to suggest a variation in these theories in an effort to make them more accurate for traffic densities less than optimum. The theory as modified for noncongested traffic may help to describe quantitatively the sudden change of state occurring in a traffic stream going from a relatively free-flowing condition to a crawling stop-and-go condition and back again.},

	abstract="This chapter presents the basic traffic flow theory which is used in the following chapters for control problem formulations. The theory develops the Lighthill--Whitham--Richards (LWR) model that uses the conservation law for traffic. Additionally, a density-dependent speed formula is used. There are many relationships available for this fundamental diagram, the chapter uses Greenshields' formula for further analysis. Elementary partial differential equations (PDE) theory is also presented including the method of characteristics needed for the analysis of the traffic model. Shockwaves and weak solutions are discussed followed by a brief discussion of traffic measurements.",

We prove that the resulting Cauchy Problem with infinitely many differential equations admits a global unique solution. The total variation of the discrete density being uniformly bounded, as the proper length of each vehicle vanishes the infinite microscopic model converges to the macroscopic LWR model based on a first order PDE. Finally, the case of traffic flow with monotone density is discussed, with applications to real situations.}
