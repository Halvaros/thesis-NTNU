\chapter*{Abstract}

This thesis considers a Follow-the-Leader model where the velocity of a vehicle depends both on the distance to the vehicle ahead and the position of the vehicle. The main part of the thesis is a proof that the microscopic Follow-the-Model model converges in the many particle limit to the macroscopic Lighthill-Whitham-Richards model for traffic flow, with a space dependent flux.
