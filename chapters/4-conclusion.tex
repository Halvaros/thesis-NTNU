\chapter{Conclusion}

We have shown that the Follow-the-Leader model converges to the unique weak entropy solution of the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards model for traffic flow, with space dependence. First, we proved that the scheme was uniformly bounded in total variation and that the maximal distance between two vehicles converge to zero. These were the key ingredients to prove compactness of the sequence of approximations, using Kolmagorov-Riesz and the Arzela-Ascoli theorem. Using the properties of the scheme, we showed that any limit of a convergent subsequence is a weak solution, and in fact a kru≈ækov entropy solution. The uniqueness of the entropy solution ensures that the entire sequence converges.
